## Objective
Introduce neural network fundamentals and high-level concepts.

## Work Done
Covered perceptron, feedforward neural network architecture, activation functions (sigmoid, ReLU), loss functions (cross-entropy, MSE) and the idea of backpropagation at a conceptual level. Discussed where neural networks are appropriate vs classical ML models.

## Skills / Tools
- Neural network concepts and architecture
- Comparative understanding with classical ML

## Next Steps / Notes
Prepare a simple toy dataset to experiment with a basic neural network next session.
