## Objective
Learn how to control program flow with conditionals and loops.

## Work Done
Implemented examples using `if`, `elif`, and `else` conditions and loop constructs (`for`, `while`). Built small scripts that processed lists with loops and used comprehensions for concise transformations. Discussed common pitfalls like infinite loops and mutable default arguments in functions.

## Skills / Tools
- Conditional logic, loops, list comprehensions
- Debugging simple runtime issues

## Next Steps / Notes
Use code cells to demonstrate loop-based data aggregation on a small CSV file.
