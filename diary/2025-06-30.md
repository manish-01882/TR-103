## Objective
Introduce NumPy array operations for efficient numerical computation.

## Work Done
Created NumPy arrays and practiced indexing, slicing and reshaping. Performed arithmetic, aggregations, and broadcasting examples to compare performance against Python lists. Demonstrated vectorized operations to replace explicit Python loops for numeric tasks.

## Skills / Tools
- NumPy array manipulation and vectorization
- Performance awareness for numerical tasks

## Next Steps / Notes
Rewrite a small loop-based computation using NumPy vectorization and compare runtimes.
