## Objective
Apply EDA and visualization techniques on a real-world dataset.

## Work Done
Combined previous techniques on a publicly available dataset: performed cleaning, transformation, and produced a set of visual insights. Documented findings, potential feature ideas, and anomalies that require domain checking before modeling.

## Skills / Tools
- Integrated EDA workflows
- Insight documentation for modeling

## Next Steps / Notes
Finalize a short list of candidate features to be used in the mini-project.
