## Objective
Understand functions, modularity, and code reuse in Python.

## Work Done
Learned how to define functions, pass arguments, use return values, and document functions with docstrings. Practiced splitting code into modules and importing functions across notebooks. Implemented utility functions for data loading and simple cleaning tasks to promote reuse.

## Skills / Tools
- Function design, modular code structure
- Docstrings and simple unit testing approach

## Next Steps / Notes
Refactor an earlier practice notebook into reusable modules and add them to the repo.
