## Objective
Deepen understanding of NumPy numerical utilities.

## Work Done
Practiced linear algebra helpers (dot, transpose), masking, boolean indexing, and type conversions. Used NumPy for basic statistical computations (mean, median, standard deviation) on synthetic arrays. Discussed precision and dtype choices for memory/performance tradeoffs.

## Skills / Tools
- Linear algebra basics in NumPy
- Advanced indexing and masking

## Next Steps / Notes
Apply boolean indexing to filter rows in a small numeric dataset.
