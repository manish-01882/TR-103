Interpreted final model outputs, generated confusion matrices, ROC curves (if applicable), and error analysis to identify common failure modes. Discussed limitations due to dataset size, feature selection, and sampling bias. Compiled recommended next steps for future work to address limitations.

## Skills / Tools
- Error analysis and model interpretation
- Ethical considerations and limitations documentation

## Next Steps / Notes
Draft the limitations and future work section for the project report.
