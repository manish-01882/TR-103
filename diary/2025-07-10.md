## Objective
Learn linear regression modeling and evaluation.

## Work Done
Explored ordinary least squares, assumptions behind linear regression, and residual analysis. Implemented a linear regression model using scikit-learn, interpreted coefficients, and computed evaluation metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE). Practiced plotting predicted vs actual values.

## Skills / Tools
- scikit-learn linear regression
- Regression diagnostics

## Next Steps / Notes
Check residual patterns for heteroscedasticity and consider transformations if present.
