## Objective
Set up the development environment for Data Science work.

## Work Done
Installed Python (recommended 3.8+), set up a virtual environment, and installed essential packages (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, jupyter). Configured and launched Jupyter Notebook and explored its interface. Verified installations by running simple import checks and a "Hello, Data Science" notebook that printed library versions.

## Skills / Tools
- Python, venv/virtualenv, pip
- Jupyter Notebook basics

## Next Steps / Notes
Commit a short setup checklist to the project repo and document any environment issues encountered.
