## Objective
Prepare project dataset for modeling through cleaning and feature work.

## Work Done
Applied data cleaning steps tailored to the project dataset: imputations, encoding categorical variables, scaling numeric features, and creating derived features based on domain insight. Logged each transformation and produced a pipeline script for reproducibility.

## Skills / Tools
- Feature engineering, encoding, scaling
- Reproducible preprocessing pipeline

## Next Steps / Notes
Save a transformed dataset snapshot and back up preprocessing scripts in the repo.
