## Objective
Train baseline models and establish reference performance metrics.

## Work Done
Trained classical ML models (linear/logistic regression, decision tree, KNN) as baseline approaches. Logged training results, confusion matrices, and baseline evaluation metrics. Identified strengths/weaknesses of each baseline and selected a candidate model for improvement.

## Skills / Tools
- Model training, result logging
- Baseline selection methodology

## Next Steps / Notes
Choose one or two models for focused tuning and experiment tracking.
